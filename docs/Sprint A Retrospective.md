# Sprint A Retrospective #

A Sprint retrospective is done at the end of each sprint and should cover the following.

## What Went Well ##
- **Team Collaboration**: The team collaborated effectively, sharing ideas and solutions during daily standups.
- **Task Completion**: Managed to complete most of the user stories and tasks planned for the sprint.
- **Quality of Work**: Code reviews were thorough, ensuring that the code quality remained high.

## What Could Be Improved ##
- **Time Management**: Some tasks took longer than expected, which delayed other dependent tasks.
- **Better Estimation**: Some user stories were underestimated. Need to improve in the estimation process.
- **Communication**: While overall communication was good, there were instances where it could be improved for clearer understanding.
- **Better Issue Descriptions**: While various Jira issues had descriptions, often they were too short and not informative/clear enough for Team members to be able to implement the task efficiently.

## Action Items for Next Sprint ##
- **Enhance Communication**: Communicate each decision to the team through WhatsApp group or Teams group.
- **Prioritize Tasks**: Add a prioritization field in Jira to issues. Set dependencies of issues in Jira.
- **Detail Issues**: Add more descriptive descriptions (possible steps, examples, links) to issues with linked issues to see dependencies.

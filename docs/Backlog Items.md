# Backlog Items #

Backlog items are created based on client project specifications, and the technical and research needs of the team/project, and are traceable to client requirements.

## Naming ##
Backlog items follow the requirement names defined in the client requirement list. Those should include the ID of the client requirement (e.g. "ID310 - Create building floor room"). Other project-related backlog items should be named in User Story writing style with the role, need, and value defined.

## Types ##

The following backlog item (issue) types are used:

* Epic - A large user story that can be broken down into smaller stories.
* User Story - A small piece of work that represents some value to the user.
* Task - Small distinct piece of work.
* Technical - A task that is not visible to the user.
* Knowledge - Related to research and information gathering. A task that is not visible to the user.
* Bug - A bug that needs to be fixed.
* Sub-task - a sub-issue type item that is created for clear division of work for a single US (other issue type), it follows the same definition as the parent issue and is moved to the *Done* state together with the parent.

## States ##

* To Do - The backlog item is not yet started.
* In Progress - The backlog item is being worked on.
* Testing - the US implementation is being tested (e. g. unit tests are being written for it).
* Done - The backlog item is completed.

## Estimation ##

Story points are used to estimate the effort required to implement a backlog item. 

The following scale is used:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... (doubling).

The value of story points means the estimated number of hours needed to complete the backlog item, including the possible of need for extendent time due to unexpected problems.

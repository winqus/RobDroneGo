# Testing Strategy #

For testing the developed code, the following tools will be used:
- JavaScript testing tools (mainly jest, sinon, mocha, karma),
- API endpoint testing tools (Postman, Cypress)

The following test will be developed for the project implementation code:
- Unit (with JS tools, mainly Jest, Jasmine, Mocha, karma)
- Integration (with JS tools, mainly Jest, Jasmine, Mocha, karma)
- System (E2E) (with Postman), replaced by Cypress when Angular was introduced

Tests should be written after each US code implementation.

## Personal data used

Email address is used for the registration process, and it is part of the user's login information. It is also used for sending updates of terms and rules if occurs and as a general channel of communication with the user, 

## Purpose and basis of that processing  

Purpose of the data processing is to be able to create individual users to the system and allow authentication and different level of rights to each user based on their role and needs.

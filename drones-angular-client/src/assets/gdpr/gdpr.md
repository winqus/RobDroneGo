**The processing of personal data**<br><br>

The process of data collection begins when a user registers for the service. It ends when the user terminates their interactions with ISEP, which may encompass activities such as studying, teaching, or other service engagements with ISEP or when deleting the user account of RobDroneGo. Personal data will not be given to any third party.<br><br>

Name

Phone number

**Purpose**<br><br>

The purposes of the data processing are to be able to create individual users in the system to allow authentication and different levels of rights to each user based on their role and to contact the user in case of important updates, notifications, support-related issues, and general communication.<br><br>

**Basis of processing**<br><br>

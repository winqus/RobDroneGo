**Welcome!**<br><br>

Welcome to the RobDroneGo project, an innovative venture aimed at developing a solution for managing a fleet of robots to perform diverse tasks within a university campus. This project is designed to enhance efficiency and automate various operations such as object delivery and surveillance. <br><br>

This project is part of an Informatics Engineering student's third-years studies at ISEP. The teamwork project combines skills across subject boundaries. Students gain knowledge in variable fields in software development, system administration, and algorithms. They also practice soft skills needed in working life such as communication and teamwork.

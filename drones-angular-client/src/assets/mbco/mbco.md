**Minimum Business Continuity Objective** <br><br>

The mission of RoboDroneGo is to have a fleet of robots, that can move around the campus and do delivery tasks. There are also users, with different purposes:<br><br>

- System administrator – manages users and their authorizations.
- Fleet manager – manages robot and drone data and task types.
- Campus manager – manages route and map data.
- User (student, teacher, employee) – requests the execution of tasks.<br><br>

Users can perform the task via graphical user interface that also contains 3D visualization of the building's floors.
The minimum level of operability that must be maintained during an infrastructure disruption is that _robots can do delivery tasks_.
The demands linked to this task to work are following:<br><br>

- There's at least one robot capable of working.
- The robot can move freely: the elevators work, and the building floors are free of anything extra (water, trash etc.).
- The users can request tasks: they can log in to the system and make a task request.
- The Task Manager can access the system to approve task requests as well and their scheduling.
- The server, where the database is saved is up and working (robots can access the database to calculate the route of delivery, the authentication of the users and Task Manager is working).<br><br>

**MBCO**<br><br>

**Robot**<br><br>

There's all the time the minimum of one robot in working condition and having enough power in battery
Robot(s) can freely move around the campus.<br><br>

**User** <br><br>

The user is all the time capable to log in to the system and make a task request.<br><br>

**Task Manager**<br><br>

The Task Manager is all the time capable to log in to the system and to approve task requests and their scheduling.<br><br>

**Server**<br><br>

The server is up and working so robots can access the database to calculate the route of delivery, the authentication of the users and Task Manager is working.<br><br>

**User Interface**<br><br>

The user interface is up and has all the time the possibility foe existing users to log in and make task request.<br><br>
